"""test_reach.py <pr-number>

List the symbols a PR adds that **no test mentions anywhere**.

A test file in the diff is not coverage. A PR can add a test that exercises no
production code at all -- builds its own fixture, reimplements the logic inside
the test body, and asserts on its own result. It passes with the entire fix
reverted, and it passes CI, so nothing downstream objects. The only cheap way to
catch it is to check reachability in the other direction: take the symbols the
PR introduced and ask whether the test tree names any of them.

Zero hits on a symbol is not automatically a defect -- a private helper covered
through its caller is fine. It is a question worth asking, and the answer takes
seconds:

    "_sanitize_result_for_source_columns: 0 test references"

Read the flagged symbol's caller and decide whether the behaviour is genuinely
exercised. What you must not do is infer coverage from a changed test file.
