"""round_report.py <base-branch> [--since ISO8601] [--me LOGIN]

The report pass. Emits one JSON record per PR touched this round, carrying the
three things a report needs and a review round reliably forgets:

  * ``url``          -- the PR link, so every row in the artifact is clickable
  * ``reviewed_at``  -- when the review was actually submitted, per PR
  * ``reviews`` /
    ``comments``     -- the full body text you posted, so the artifact can
                        expand into what was said instead of paraphrasing it

Why a script rather than recalling it: by report time the merged PRs have
dropped out of ``queue.py``'s open list, and the bodies you posted are hundreds
of lines back in the transcript. Both are exactly the things that get quietly
approximated. This reads them back from the API.

``--since`` bounds "this round". It decides which *merged* PRs are included --
open PRs against <base> are always listed -- and which reviews count as this
round's rather than a previous one's.

The default is the **previous round's end time**, read from the ledger. A fixed
clock window is wrong in both directions: too wide and it reports PRs that
landed before the round opened (and then warns you never reviewed them), too
narrow and it drops a long round's earliest merges. With no ledger history yet
it falls back to 12h and says so on stderr.

Usage:
    python3 round_report.py development > /tmp/round.json
    python3 round_report.py development --since 2026-08-21T15:00:00Z

Piping the result into the artifact build is the point; read it with jq to spot
check, e.g. `jq -r '.[] | "\\(.number) \\(.verdict) \\(.reviewed_at)"' /tmp/round.json`
