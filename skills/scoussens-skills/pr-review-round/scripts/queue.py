"""queue.py <base-branch>

The triage pass. Every open non-draft PR against <base>, oldest first, with the
three facts that decide what you do next: who is actually blocking (you or the
author), whether CI is even meaningful yet, and how risky the changed paths are.

Run this once at the start of a round. Reviewing in creation order matters --
the oldest PRs have the most accumulated review history to reconcile, and
merging them first is what stops the queue growing.

# Risk tiers drive review depth. Classify by the *riskiest* path in the diff:
# a PR touching a migration and a stylesheet is a DATA PR, not a WEB one.
#
# These patterns are deliberately generic — they are the vocabulary most stacks
# share, not one repo's layout. Add your repo's own names (a migration prefix,
# an ORM class, a package dir) in `.pr-review-tiers.json` at the repo root:
#
#     {"DATA": ["V001", "il_specs"], "API": ["ILCrud"]}
#
# The point is the OTHER count printed at the end. Tier-driven depth is this
# script's whole purpose, so a queue where most PRs land in OTHER means the
# patterns do not fit this repo and the depth column should not be trusted --
# far better to say so than to let every PR quietly read as low risk.
# Anchor every pattern that could appear inside a longer word: a bare "entity"
# matches "identity" and files an auth change as DATA. Prefer "/entities/" to
# "entity", "/seed/" to "seed".
#
# Order is load-bearing: the first match wins, so the stricter tier must come
# first. DATA before AUTH is deliberate — auth vocabulary ("secret", "token")
# appears incidentally across a large diff, while a migration path does not.
