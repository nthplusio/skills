"""Mechanically checkable assertions for pr-teacher eval outputs.

Emits JSON to stdout: {run_dir: {assertion_id: {passed, evidence}}}

Design note (learned from iteration-1 baselines): detectors must recognize
EVERY reasonable idiom, not just the one the skill happens to recommend.
A first pass looked only for <details> and "reveal answer" and scored a
perfectly good multiple-choice quiz as zero — which would have manufactured
a win for the skill out of a measurement artifact. When in doubt, widen the
detector and let the grader agent judge quality.

Two separate things are measured, because they are separate:
  selfcheck_present            -> predict-then-check Q&A, any implementation
  interaction_simulates_model  -> an instrument that models THIS PR's own
                                  mechanism (run the regex, step the
                                  interleaving, compose the trust store).
                                  A quiz does not count; it is graded above.

#   1. Don't merge into one alternation - a quiz item usually carries BOTH
#      `data-qid` and `class="quiz-item"`, so an alternation double-counts.
#   2. Don't count bare `<details>` - the skill also tells authors to build the
#      file-map nodes as disclosures, so a page with 10 questions and 4 tree
#      nodes reads as 15 questions and fails a 6-10 check it actually passed.
